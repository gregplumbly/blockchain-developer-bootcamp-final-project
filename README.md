# Dapp project idea - decentralized staking with dynamic NFT

## Creating a staking app

A solidity contract that collects an ERC20 token from users, and the user receives a token that represents their deposit. e.g if the user deposited ABC they would receive sABC (staked ABC).

In addition, after depositing a minimum amount the user is eligible to mint an NFT. The NFT has some dynamic properties perhaps displayed via SVG using Chainlink.

A UI that allows a user to use Metamask

A user can withdraw their stake.

Stretch goal, display amounts staked and other stats from a subgraph.
